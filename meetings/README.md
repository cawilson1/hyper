# Project Meetings

All project meeting agendas and notes will be documented here. Each agenda will
be published a few days before the meeting and encourage all members to provide
status updates in the agenda so that we can minimize the need for complex note
taking.

A template of an agenda is found in the `meetings` folder and each meeting
document should be named in the following format. `yyyy-mm-dd.md` and placed in
the meeting folder of the repository.
